Predicting House in Chennai: A Linear Regression Approach

Technologies Involved
Python: programming language for development.
Numpy : For numerical computations and array operations.
Pandas : Data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn : Statistical data visualization.
scikit-learn : Machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
FastAPI : Fast web framework for building APIs with Python.

Modeling: Linear Regression
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (rent price) and one or more independent variables (features). We will use the scikit-learn library to implement the linear regression model.
